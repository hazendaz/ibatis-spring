The Mybatis 'ibatis-spring' module is a copy from spring 3.2.x as a shaded module in order to allow users using ibatis to 
freely upgrade to spring4+ without having a hard dependency on upgrading ibatis in the process.

This repository is read-only. Consider upgrading to [MyBatis](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3) with [MybatisSpring](https://github.com/mybatis/spring).
